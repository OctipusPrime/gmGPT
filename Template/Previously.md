Narrator:
The evening sun sets, casting long shadows and a warm glow over the wild countryside of the Sword Coast. To the west, rolling waves of the Trackless Sea crash against the rocky cliffs. To the east, the vast plains of the Fields of the Dead stretch out, dotted with ancient barrows and forgotten battlefields. 

Ahead, a narrow dirt path snakes its way through the tall, golden grasses, leading toward the distant silhouette of Baldur's Gate. Wisps of smoke rise from the city, hinting at the bustling life within its high stone walls. Behind, the homesteader's village shrinks in the distance, their modest thatched roofs and cultivated fields offering a peaceful contrast to the wild nature of the Sword Coast.

In the midst of this expansive landscape, Chubby snorts and grunts impatiently, her hooves pawing at the soft earth. She is a sturdy boar, with tusks as sharp as steel and a hide tougher than most armour.

A soft breeze rustles through the grass, carrying with it a faint whiff of salty sea air and the distant sounds of civilization. The quiet is punctuated only by the occasional cry of a distant bird or the rustle of a small creature in the undergrowth. It's peaceful, yet the homesteader's words echo in your mind, hinting at the danger that may be lurking within the old ruins.

Player:
Ram stretches in the saddle and yawns. "It's gonna be a long night if we don't find the town soon. I would have guessed more folk be seen around if we were close, but it's evening upon ya already. Most be already at home eating their dinner, ey?" Ram says to Chubby who responds with her usual grunts.

Narrator:
Chubby's grunts carry a note of agreement, the boar's intelligent eyes scanning the surrounding environment. The path continues, snaking its way through the fields, the grass shifting to a brilliant orange as the sun continues its descent.

Suddenly, a flicker of movement catches your eye. Up ahead, near a curve in the path, stands a figure. The figure is tall and lean, his silhouette backlit by the setting sun. He seems to be dressed in a long cloak, its edges fluttering slightly in the breeze. A wide-brimmed hat obscures his face, making it difficult to discern any distinguishing features.

As you approach, the figure lifts a hand, palm outward in a clear signal for you to halt. His voice is deep, carrying easily in the quiet evening air. "Halt, traveller," he says, "The path ahead can be treacherous at night. Tell me, are you heading to Baldur's Gate?"

Player:
Ram is wary of the figure and stops a few meters short. "May be." he responds with his eyebrows furrowed. "Depends on who's asking."


Narrator:
The figure tilts his head slightly, acknowledging your wariness. His voice maintains its deep, steady tone as he replies, "Just a humble traveller, much like yourself. The name's Brom, I'm a ranger in these parts." 

He steps out of the shadows, revealing a face weathered by the elements, framed by a scruffy beard. A longbow is slung across his back and a quiver of arrows hangs at his side. His eyes, though hardened by experience, hold a glimmer of sincerity. 

"I mean you no harm," he continues, "I've just spent too many nights picking up the pieces of folk who thought they could brave the night. So, if you're heading to Baldur's Gate, I'd offer a word of advice." 

He pauses, waiting for your response. Despite his ragged appearance, there's a sense of calm authority about him, born from years surviving in the wilds. However, as is always the case on the road, the decision to trust or not lies entirely with you.

Player:
The sight and the words reassure Ram a bit and he seems to easy up slightly. What the ranger says worries him though. "Pieces of folk? That would sounds like a big problem for the lands near city such as Baldur's Gate."
  

Narrator:
Brom nods solemnly, his eyes shifting to the horizon as if contemplating the troubled state of the region. "Indeed, it has been a trying time. The city has always had its fair share of troubles, but lately, there's been an increase in bandit activity and reports of strange creatures lurking in the outskirts."

He takes a moment, his gaze returning to meet yours. "If you still wish to continue, I'd suggest traveling with caution. Keep your weapon at the ready, and stay on the main road. It's well-traveled, and there's safety in numbers."

Brom's words hang in the air, his cautionary tone a reminder of the dangers that lie ahead. The decision to proceed or seek another path is yours, Ram.

Player:
"Eye, will do."
